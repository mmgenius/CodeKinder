# Code Kinder Project

This is an academic and collaborative project. 
The principal idea is to create a Web platform and some specific langage to make request from API rest to check of get data. 

#Notation <br/> 
This is some rules before pulling request / pushing new branch into master. <br/>
    ##### Right branch name : PREFIXE_FEATURE <br/>
            ------ Prefixe : User_Name <br/>
            ------ Feature : Work theme <br/>

#Workflow : 
To keep a lineaire workflow, we proced like below : <br/>
    ##### - Stayed up to date from local master<br/>
    ##### - Commited you changes <br/>
    ##### - Checked out into new local branch and pushed it to server<br/>
    ##### - Create a new merge request to merge branche into master<br/>
    ##### Note : When the maintener accepts you merge request, you remote branche will be deleted<br/>
    ##### - You have to return in the local master branch and make Pull to update local file <br/>
    ##### - You can see a little example below <br/>
